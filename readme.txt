Adds Nigeria (postal) states to WooCommerce's list of states.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the Nigerian States to your WooCommerce store. 

It  makes it possible for your Nigerian based customers to choose a Nigerian state from a drop down list after choosing Nigeria as their country in either of their billing or shipping address.

This plugin helps you maintain order and reduce the chances that your customers encounter stress while filling their address details on your WooCommerce store. Plus as admin you can specify what Nigerian state you are selling from in your WooCommerce settings.

**The plugin does two simple things for you**

* Give your Nigerian based customers a better experience by showing them a drop-down list they could pick their state.
* Give you (the admin) the benefit of specifying your the state your shop is based on your back-end.
